## About us
We are a research network at Uppsala University. Our aim is to unite Bayesian modellers and to make Bayesian inference accessible to researchers with diverse backgrounds. 
We organise networking events, turorials, workshops and conferences on Bayesian inference and the probabilistic programming language Stan. Our network is open to all students and researchers at Uppsala University.

## Motivation
Bayesian models are being increasingly used across the social and natural sciences to make
sense of real-world data. We thus view Bayesian inference as an interdisciplinary node that can unite researchers across fields. Hence the name *interBayes*, where *inter* stands for *interdisciplinary*. 

## Contact
Contact Sara Hamis (see <a href="https://interbayes.github.io/people/">People</a>) to join or learn more about our network and <a href="https://interbayes.github.io/events/">events</a>.  

## Funding
Our network is funded by the Centre for Integrated Research on Culture and Society (<a href="https://www.uu.se/centrum/circus">Circus</a>).
